      The idea behind this project has been inspired from actor Joseph Gordon-Levittâ€™s open organization, hitRECord, where users are able to contribute their works and collaborate with others in creating bigger projects. 
      The inner-workings of our project revolves around this idea of collaboration in that we all try to finish one story, together. The main purpose of this project is to get everyone to unleash their inner creativity and imaginations together. 
      Our project is not sponsored, for profit, nor funded.
