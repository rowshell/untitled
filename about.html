      Producers notes: 

      Tiffany Huang: I always enjoyed reading while growing up and were amazed by what authors come up with what is called a “story.”  It’s a unique feeling to be able to invest in characters that somehow relate to you so similarly.  
      Consequently, I am often amazed at the creativity authors possess to develop such fascinating stories and characters that many audiences can relate too.  However, when I say authors, I do not just mean the people who write books.  
      When I say authors, I am talking about people who create and conjure a piece of work, such as books, movies, paintings, and plays.  The creativity, imagination, and vision of authors never ceases to amaze me as I sit down to appreciate 
      their piece of work.  I never thought of myself as a creative and visionary person; only the type of person that would enjoy the creativity of others.  However, I always had this dream of writing at least one book in life or create something 
      I never thought I would in my life.  But I always told myself that it would be unlikely.  So when Rochelle asked me one night in the summer of 2015 during summer school at UCSD if I wanted to join in creating a website, I saw that impossible 
      dream evolve into a reality.  At first, I thought it would be for fun, creating our own story while integrating it with our field of study at UCSD, computer science.  But as we began to develop our storyline, I knew that it was for real.  
      I remember always mentioning to Rochelle several items from my “invisible bucket list,” such as making a music video or everyday-life blogs; items that just come to my head and I suggest we should do for fun.  Both of us attended a Wong Fu 
      Productions conversation during the end of our freshman year and we admire their work greatly.  Inspired by them and their conversation that day at school, I would often mention that we should start our own projects and film short stories. 
      But of course, I knew it was only a distant dream, knowing that we did not have the proper equipment or time commitment while focusing on school.  But when Rochelle asked me to join her in developing a website that integrated the idea of creating 
      a story, we both knew that this would be the start of the project that I always mentioned during the school year that we should start doing.  Quite similar to the concepts of WFP, we will put our ideas down on paper as opposed to filming it on a 
      technological device.  We, of course, wanted to start this project from scratch and use the skills that we acquired from school to make our vision become a reality.   

      Rochelle Manongdo:
      During the year, I went to a Wong Fu Productions meet-up at school (UCSD) with Tiffany and I remember her saying she wanted to make a project like they did. She wanted to do videos about our times at university but we didn’t have proper equipment 
      to do so. However during the summer when I would sleep over her place for summer school, this idea of creating a website in which we have people pitch in ideas of their own to create a this massive story suddenly came up. She would read before bed 
      and I would freewrite whenever I got the chance. I guess stringing these interests of ours created this project. We wanted to start this from scratch and create everything ourselves as a way to show that we didn’t need much techy equipment to create 
      something we think is beyond what we imagine.
